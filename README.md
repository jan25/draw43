# draw43

Yet another 14 Feb project. This time it is 2D line drawing with Fourier series.

The input to the program is a SVG file. It gets transformed to Fourier series and gets fed to a drawing program. Which then simulates series as epicycles.

Drawing a rose isn't a bad idea: [see demo](https://jan25.github.io/draw43/?k=flow&speed=3).

Find complete workflow in design section below.

## Fourier

Complex Fourier series: any function can be expressed as sum of sine and cosine functions, and as the number of such functions approach âˆž, the sum approaches original function. "Complex" because all this can be achieved with complex vectors rotating in complex plane each with some frequency.
