# draw43

Yet another 14 Feb project. This time it is 2D line drawing with Fourier series. Drawing a rose isn't a bad idea.

The input to the program is a svg file, which gets transformed to Fourier series and gets fed to a drawing program. It then simulates series as epicycles.

See a rose being drawn here: <TODO LINK> with debug param.

## Fourier

Complex Fourier series: any function can be expressed as sum of sine and cosine functions, and as number of such functions approach âˆž, the sum approaches original function. "Complex" because all this can be achieved with complex vectors rotating in complex plane each with some frequency.

Motivation: [What is fourier series? (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=r6sGWTCMz2k)

## Relevant topics

Fourier transforms, Bazier curves, Affine transformation, P5js, Blender

## TODO

- Show % complete on zoom
- Add restart drawing option during/on finish
- Background color (make lighter, see for e.g. raw image in browser)
- Mobile support - dimensions and event handlers
